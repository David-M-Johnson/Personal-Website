          <p class="bio">
            I am a senior studying engineering physics at Cornell University. My
            interests are in plasma physics, computational science, fusion
            devices, and astrophysics. I also enjoy software development,
            writing, and outdoor adventures.
            <br />
            <br />
            Two years ago, I became interested in fusion energy because of its
            potential to provide clean, inexpensive power with readily
            accessible fuel that could reduce geopolitical conflict over natural
            resources.

            <br />
            <br />
            Since the fall of 2023, I have researched under several professors,
            including Drs.

            <br />
            <br />
            After graduation, I plan to continue plasma research or work for a
            startup. During this time, I hope to decide whether to pursue
            graduate school and, if so, whether my work would be computational, 
            experimental, or something entirely new.
            <br />
            <br />
            I also enjoy adventuring in the great outdoors. I wear many hats for
            <a href="https://scl.cornell.edu/coe">Cornell Outdoor Education</a>.
            This summer, I taught a tree climbing class in the California
            Redwoods!
            <br />
            <br />
            I also love to tinker. There is something uniquely rewarding about
            building things, whether in the machine shop or on a keyboard. If
            you have an idea for something to build, please let me know. I would
            love to hear about your projects and potentially work together!
            <br />
            <br />
            Much of my free time is spent reading and writing. I read anything
            trusted friends suggest. Right now, I am especially enjoying
            philosophical fiction, spy novels, and history of science. I also
            write about culture, literature, philosopy, and theology. I am the
            senior editor of<i>
