          <h2>Magnetic Reconnection of Dual Exploder</h2>
          <p>
            Magnetic Reconnection&mdash;the process where magnetic field lines
            break and reconnect, changing magnetic topology&mdash;is a
            fundamental process responsible for solar flares, auroras, and other
            astrophysical phenomena. Alongside two other undergrads, Jonathan
            Lee and Mandy Chen, I helped Dr. Jack Hare simulate and analyze the
            magnetic reconnection of two exploding wire arrays. We compared
            results to an experimental campaign done on MAIZE by Dr. Hare and
            Thomas Varnish.

          <h2>Gas Puff Release Mechanism</h2>
          <p>
            In the summer of 2024, I developed a gas release mechanism for
            exploding gas puff Z-pinches. I wrote a script to simulate the
            explosion dynamics using the snowplow model to optimize the
            geometry, designed the part to be compact and veristile, and
            fabricated it using mill, lathe, and other machine tools. It is
            currently being used for experiments on COBRA.

          <h2>HPC Job Status Monitor</h2>
          <p>
            This summer, I made an HPC Job Monitor, a Python tool to track the status of HPC jobs through SSH in a GUI.
            The app checks in the status of you jobs at a specificed interval and returns the latest!
            It also keeps track of completed jobs so you have a log, and when you reopen it, it picks up from where it left off.
            Unfortunetly, after two weeks, Imperial College blocked authentication via Paramiko (the python library I was using).
            I switched the program to use "keyboard-interactive" authentication, and now it works again! 
            We'll see how long it takes Imperial to prevent this method.

          <h2>Solar Panel Frequency-Response</h2>
          <p>
            I examined effect of light wavelength on solar panel efficiency.
            Sunlight is broadband&mdash;it contains a wide range of wavelength,
            and optimizing solar panels for a given light profile could increase
            energy generation. The most challenging component of this project
            was defining "efficiency." I accounted for variables like lux meter
            frequency-response and the wavelength-energy relation.
